# image-datasets

This package extends `torchvision.datasets` in the following ways:
 - Adds some commonly used datasets that are not available in `torchvision.datasets`, such as FFHQ.
 - Some datasets are not fully supported by `torchvision.datasets`. For example, `torchvision.datasets.ImageNet` does not support loading the test split of ImageNet.

## Installation

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/xyfJASON/image-datasets.git
```

## Documentation

Please see [docs](./docs) for detailed instructions on each dataset.
